# Feature Selection Flowchart for Logistic Regression

## Start the Feature Selection Process

1. **Relevance Check**
   - Ask: *Is the feature relevant to the target?*
   - If **No**, remove the feature.

2. **Data Type Check**
   - Ask: *Is the feature numeric or categorical?*
   - If **Numeric**, proceed to correlation check.
   - If **Categorical**, convert using `OneHotEncoder` or `LabelEncoder`.

3. **Missing Values**
   - Ask: *Does the feature have missing values?*
   - If **Yes**, opt to impute or remove depending on the amount and importance.

4. **Correlation with Target**
   - Ask: *Is the feature highly correlated with the target?*
   - If **No**, the feature might not be useful, consider removing.

5. **Linearity Check**
   - Ask: *Does the feature have a linear relationship with the target?*
   - If **No**, consider transforming the feature or removing it.

6. **Independence from Other Features**
   - Ask: *Is the feature independent of other features?*
   - If **No**, check for multicollinearity.

7. **Multicollinearity Check**
   - Ask: *Is there multicollinearity?*
   - If **Yes**, consider removing or combining features to mitigate.

8. **Assess Data Set Size Post-Feature Removal**
   - Ask: *Is the dataset still adequately large after potential feature removal?*
   - If **No**, consider more data collection or developing new features.

## Conclusion

- Following this systematic approach helps in maintaining a balance between model complexity and performance.
- Adapt these steps based on specific dataset characteristics or domain requirements.
